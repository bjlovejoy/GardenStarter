I am removing the DHT temperature and humidity sensor, since the RTC module (DS3231M) seems
to have a built in temp sensor.  Although I lose out on humidity, I get to save a component,
PCB space and also

gain the possibility of switching to the ATTINY85 to save an Arduino Nano.  Although this
may make reprogramming the chip a bit more difficult (an issues with I2C connection for
the RTC and LCD), would be the better approach.

I will continue working with the Nano for now and briefly test with the ATTiny to see
if the switch would be worth it.

Otherwise, here is the removed DHT code:



#include "DHT.h"

int DHTPIN   = 5;      //temperature and humidity sensor
int DHTTYPE  = DHT11;  //sensor used is DHT11

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);      //temperature sensor object


void temp_collection()
{
  // Reading temperature or humidity takes about 250 milliseconds!
  // Sensor readings may also be up to 2 seconds 'old' (its a very slow sensor)
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  // Read temperature as Celsius (the default)
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  // Read temperature as Fahrenheit (isFahrenheit = true)
  float f = dht.readTemperature(true);

  // Check if any reads failed and exit early (to try again).
  if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
    Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
    return;
  }

  // Compute heat index in Fahrenheit (the default)
  float hif = dht.computeHeatIndex(f, h);
  // Compute heat index in Celsius (isFahreheit = false)
  float hic = dht.computeHeatIndex(t, h, false);

  Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.print(F("째C "));
  Serial.print(f);
  Serial.print(F("째F  Heat index: "));
  Serial.print(hic);
  Serial.print(F("째C "));
  Serial.print(hif);
  Serial.println(F("째F"));
}
